## Write an Outline For Your Post

Great blog posts don’t just happen. Even the best bloggers need a rough idea to keep them on-track. This is where outlines come in.

An outline doesn’t need to be lengthy, or even detailed – it’s just a rough guide to make sure you don’t ramble on and on about something tangential to your topic.

For example, this is the outline for this post that I sent to my editor before getting to work:

## Introduction

[Quick summary explaining what the blog post will cover]

**Step 1: Plan your blog post by choosing a topic, creating an outline, conducting research, and checking facts.**

**Step 2: Craft a headline that is both informative and will capture readers’ attentions.**

**Step 3: Write your post, either writing a draft in a single session or gradually word on parts of it.**

**Step 4: Use images to enhance your post, improve its flow, add humor, and explain complex topics.**

**Step 5: Edit your blog post. Make sure to avoid repetition, read your post aloud to check its flow, have someone else read it and provide feedback, keep sentences and paragraphs short, don’t be a perfectionist, don’t be afraid to cut out text or adapt your writing last minute.**

## Wrap-up

The purpose of this outline is to make sure I know what I plan to cover, in what order the various sections will appear, and some bare-bones details of what each section will include.

Outlines keep you honest. They stop you from indulging in poorly thought-out metaphors about driving and keep you focused on the overall structure of your post. Sometimes I’ll write a more thorough outline (and sometimes I won’t bother with one at all), but most of the time, something like the outline above is perfectly acceptable.

Whether you write your outline in your word processor, on a piece of paper, or even scribbled on a bar napkin, do whatever works for you to keep you focused.

## Do Your Research

One of the biggest secrets professional bloggers don’t want you to know is that they don’t actually know everything. Truth be told, sometimes they don’t know anything about a topic before they sit down to write about it.
